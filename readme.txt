Disables ratings in the Cookbook recipe plugin.

== Description ==

This plugin disables ratings in the Cookbook recipe plugin. No one can leave a rating or view existing ratings for recipes on the front-end or back-end of the site. If recipe ratings were submitted on the site before the plugin was activated, those ratings remain in the database but cannot be viewed anywhere.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder 'disable-cookbook-ratings' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. That's it! Ratings will now be disabled in your recipes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I want to disable ratings? =

Not everyone likes having their recipes rated. Sometimes people are intentionally mean and not all blog owners want to deal with trolls. Sometimes visitors substitute ingredients or make the recipe incorrectly and are surprised when that leads to bad results. Also, visitors seem more likely to leave a review if they're unhappy with the recipe than if they liked it, which might skew the accuracy of the ratings.

= Will disabling ratings affect my SEO and/or Google ranking? =

According to the Google documentation on how to format recipes, the "AggregateRating" field used by the ratings feature is recommended but not required. However, it also says "mark up as many of the recommended fields as possible to drive better engagement in Search." So you will probably get better engagement if you include the ratings, but if your recipe has a low rating that might discourage users from clicking through from Google. It's your call.
